This is an unofficial Scala version of the BOHNANZA game for Software Engineering classes at HTWG Konstanz.

Bohnanza is a card game that revolves around trading and planting beans. Each player has a hand of bean cards, which they must plant in the order they are drawn. Players can trade beans with each other to manage their fields more effectively. The goal is to collect sets of the same type of bean and then harvest them to earn coins. The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins. The game is known for its unique rule that players cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hands, which adds a strategic layer to trading and planting decisions.
